    <h2 id="v1020">v1.0.2.0</h2>

    <p>Released ???.</p>

    <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Pressing U, H, and N now works as intended to jump to the first, nearest previous, and nearest next unreached blocks in the disassembly.</li>
        <li>The tab ordering for all elements of each window has been improved, instead of being seemingly random.</li>
        <li>Sub windows will now always appear on top of the main window instead of being somewhere seemingly random.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Changes</h4>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Important:</strong> The project file format has been updated, so old projects will be converted automatically. Make a backup just in case.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>New Features</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Added the Label List Window, which allows you to see all labels currently in the disassembly in one place. You can export and import the list of labels if you want.</li>
        <li>Labels can now be assigned to non-ROM addresses via the Label List Window. These label assignments will be appended to the end of the disassembly so Asar can see them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="v1010">v1.0.1.0</h2>

    <p>Released September 12, 2019.</p>

    <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Fixed some errors with displaying the main table near the end of the ROM.</li>
        <li>Fixed an error with opening ROMs of sizes of non-powers of 2.</li>
        <li>Fixed the intermediate address not showing for unreached bytes.</li>
        <li>Fixed an annoying error that would occur when saving a project where an alias or comment has been created then deleted.</li>
        <li>Fixed an error when jumping to the previous unreached block when no block exists.</li>
        <li>Fixed an error with the log generator that would create aliases on offsets that aren't instructions, pointers, or read points.</li>
        <li>Fixed an error that occurs when auto generating aliases for two vectors with the same offset.</li>
        <li>The data bank register column will now properly be highlighted in red when a MVP or MVN instruction is executed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Changes</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Changed the "Effective Address" column and related things to "Intermediate Address," and fixed some instructions' calculations for the intermediate address. See the help file for more details.</li>
        <li>Changed the hotkey of "Goto Effective Address" (F) to "Goto Intermediate Address" (T) to match the name change.</li>
        <li>Renamed "View" to "Tools" and added an "Options" submenu.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>New Features</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>New mapping modes have been added. ExLoROM and SuperFX mapping modes are available and automatically detected. Two SA-1 mapping modes are also available thanks to Vitor Vilela. Mode 2, Super MMC (used with the S-DD1 and SPC7110 chips), is an option, but it is not supported yet.</li>
        <li>Added "Move with Step" option that makes the selected row jump to the end of an Auto Step or Mark Many process.</li>
        <li>Added support for opening and saving *.dizraw project files. These are just normal project files, but they are uncompressed.</li>
    </ul>
