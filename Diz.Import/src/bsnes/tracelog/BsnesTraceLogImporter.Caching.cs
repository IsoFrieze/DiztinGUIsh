    // PERFORMANCE
    // this code exists ONLY for performance optimization.
    //
    // Turns out, using string.IndexOf() to find relative positions of text is SUPER SLOW.
    // Tracelogs from even a few seconds of SNES runtime can produce something like
    // 250 MILLION lines of text.
    //
    // Optimization: since the BSNES tracelogs contain lines that are always the same width with the data always
    // starting on the same offset. so, what we can take a known sample line, and then parse it ONE TIME.
    // we'll then save the position of each section of data
    //
    // This is basically the fastest way to parse text tracelogs (80 bytes per line). HOWEVER, if you really
    // want to move fast, you should use a binary file format (for BSNES, it's just 8 bytes per instruction,
    // and no text parsing required) 
    //
    // NOTE: we will make the assumption that lines in a file will always be the same width and offsets.
    // however, different versions of BSNES can output different line lengths, so always re-parse the first line
    // on each use of this file. it's up to the caller to figure that out.
